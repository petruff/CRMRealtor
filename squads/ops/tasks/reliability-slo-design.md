# Design Service Level Objectives

Materializes `@reliability-lead` `*slo-design`, with `*sli-select` as its mandatory first half —
an objective without an indicator is a slogan with a percentage sign.

## Purpose

Convert "it should be reliable" into a number, a window, and an indicator that can be computed from
data. Reliability is an engineering quantity with a cost curve, not an aspiration. The job is to
find the level at which the next failure stops being perceptible to the user or costly to the
business, and stop there deliberately.

## Boundary — read before executing

This task sets **policy**. It operates nothing.

| This task produces | Who does the rest |
|---|---|
| SLI and SLO specification | Instrumentation code → `@dev` |
| Error budget derived from the objective | Gates, freezes, pipeline changes → **`@devops`, exclusive** |
| Signal and threshold specification | Monitoring, alert routing and paging configuration → **`@devops`, exclusive** |
| Non-functional criteria | Test evidence and quality gate → `@qa` |
| Findings that only architecture can satisfy | Redundancy and failure-domain decisions → `@architect` |

Where an objective implies a change to a running system, this task writes the **specification** and
names **@devops** as the executor. If a recommendation from this task ever reads as authorization to
configure monitoring, change a pipeline, cut a release or push, it is being misread.

## Pre-conditions

| # | Condition | Blocking | How to check |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The service has a named owner who can accept the target | Yes | Ask; an unowned target is not a commitment |
| 2 | At least one critical user journey can be named | Yes | "Users experience X completing" — not "the process is up" |
| 3 | It is known whether measured history exists | Yes | Check the data source directly, do not assume |
| 4 | Any contractual or regulatory floor is on the table | No | A floor is a floor, not a target |
| 5 | Hard dependencies and their documented failover behaviour are listed | No | Missing detail becomes an UNVERIFIED entry, not a guess |

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Journeys, not components

Write down what users are doing when they experience failure. *Submit order. Load the dashboard.
Receive the confirmation.* Component uptime that does not map to a user journey measures the wrong
thing accurately. [SOURCE: *Site Reliability Engineering*, O'Reilly 2016.]

Refuse to proceed on "the API is up" as a journey.

### Step 2 — Select indicators

For each journey define one indicator in the form **good events / valid events, over a window**.

| Form | Event definition |
|---|---|
| Availability | Successful requests / valid requests |
| Latency | Requests served under a threshold / valid requests |
| Quality | Correct or complete responses / valid responses |
| Freshness | Data younger than a threshold / data served |
| Durability | Records retained / records written |

Every indicator must state three things or it is not an indicator yet:

1. **Event definition** — what counts as a good event
2. **Valid-event denominator** — what counts as an attempt; without it the ratio is meaningless
3. **Data source** — the log, stream or metric it is computed from

Qualification tests:

- Does it move when users suffer, and stay still when they do not? → good indicator
- Does it require a human to interpret before it means anything? → not an indicator yet
- Is it computable from data that exists today? → if not, it becomes an instrumentation request for `@dev`, and any objective on it is provisional until the data exists

### Step 3 — Set the target and the window

Every objective is a target **and** a measurement window **and** a justification.

| Situation | Rule |
|---|---|
| Users cannot perceive the difference between the current and the proposed level | Do not buy it |
| A contractual or regulatory floor exists | It is a floor; set the internal objective above it so the internal signal fires first |
| The dependency chain already caps achievable reliability | The objective cannot exceed the weakest hard dependency without redundancy work — say so explicitly and route to `@architect` |
| Measured history exists | Set the first objective near observed performance, then tighten deliberately |
| No measured history at all | Declare a provisional objective, mark it UNVERIFIED, set a review date after one full window |

**100% is the wrong target.** [SOURCE: *Site Reliability Engineering*, O'Reilly 2016, Ch. 3
"Embracing Risk".] Past a point the user cannot perceive the difference, and the cost of the next
nine is paid entirely by you. Users cannot reach you at 100% anyway — their networks, devices and
intermediaries fail below whatever you achieve.

### Step 4 — Derive the error budget

The budget is the objective's complement over the window. [SOURCE: SRE book, Ch. 3.]

| Objective | Budget over a 30-day window |
|---|---|
| 99.0% | approximately 7h 12m |
| 99.5% | approximately 3h 36m |
| 99.9% | approximately 43m 12s |
| 99.95% | approximately 21m 36s |
| 99.99% | approximately 4m 19s |

The budget is the release, migration, experiment and drill allowance. It is not a shameful residue
to be driven to zero — treating it that way converts a velocity mechanism into a fear mechanism.

Report burn **rate against window**, never remaining balance alone. A budget half spent in one hour
and half spent over a quarter are different situations with different responses.

### Step 5 — State what is not being proposed

Name the objective you are declining and why. A target that architecture caps rather than effort
is an `@architect` conversation, not a target-setting one. Say that in the document rather than
quietly setting a number nobody can hold.

### Step 6 — Mark provenance

Constitution Article IV — No Invention. Every number traces to measured data, a stated business
commitment, or a named assumption marked **UNVERIFIED** with a review date. An SLO document where
measured and assumed figures are indistinguishable is worse than no document, because it will be
quoted in a contract.

### Step 7 — Name the executing authority for every downstream consequence

If this objective will feed an error budget policy, state now — in the document — that every gate,
freeze and release consequence is executed by `@devops` under their exclusive authority. A policy
whose consequences do not name their executor leads directly to someone outside `@devops` reaching
for a pipeline they do not hold.

### Step 8 — Persist

Write the SLO document to a versioned file in the repository, with an owner and a review date. A
reliability target that lives in a dashboard configuration nobody can review is not a policy
(Constitution Article I — CLI First).

## Handoff

| To | When |
|---|---|
| `@ops:ops-chief` | The reliability question turns out to be a flow, waste or incident question, or the target conflicts with another operational policy and needs arbitration |
| `@ops:flow-lead` | The objective is limited by where work piles up rather than by the service — the constraint decides throughput before any target does |
| `@ops:lean-lead` | The operational load behind the target is process waste rather than technical toil |
| `@ops:incident-lead` | Budget burn indicates an active incident, or a postmortem must feed targets and accepted risks |
| `@architect` | The objective is unreachable without redundancy, failover or dependency isolation |
| `@dev` | Instrumentation, exporters or automation must be implemented before an indicator is computable |
| `@qa` | The target must be expressed as verifiable non-functional acceptance criteria with evidence |
| `@devops` | Every pipeline, gate, freeze, release, monitoring configuration and push action — **exclusive authority, no exceptions** |
| `@pm` | The target implies scope or roadmap consequences that need epic framing |
