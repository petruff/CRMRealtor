  - "[ ] Phase 5: agent memory structure, hygiene rules and size limits proposed"
  - "[ ] Phase 6: recommendations sorted by impact, grouped by effort, given exact implementation steps and a weekly time-saved estimate"
  - "[ ] No allow rule added for a destructive operation just to reduce prompts"

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Source | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|--------|----------|------------|
| project_path | string | User or cwd | Yes | Must contain .claude/ directory |
| pain_points | string[] | User | No | Described bottlenecks (e.g., "too many permission prompts") |
| workflow_type | enum | User | No | `solo-dev`, `team-review`, `ci-cd`, `exploratory` |

---

## Preconditions

- Claude Code integration exists (.claude/ directory present)
- User has used Claude Code on this project at least once

---

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Analyze Usage Patterns

Examine current configuration to infer usage patterns:

1. **CLAUDE.md analysis**: what instructions are present, what is missing
2. **settings.json review**: current allow/deny rules, how restrictive
3. **Rules inventory**: how many rules, what domains they cover
4. **Hook presence**: what automation exists
5. **Command/skill inventory**: custom commands and skills defined
6. **Project size estimation**: file count, language distribution

Classify the current configuration maturity:
| Level | Description | Typical Signs |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Starter | Minimal setup | Only CLAUDE.md, no rules, no hooks |
| Intermediate | Functional | CLAUDE.md + settings + some rules |
| Advanced | Optimized | Full rules, hooks, skills, MCP configured |
| Expert | Fully automated | CI/CD integration, custom hooks, agent teams |

### Phase 2: Identify Bottlenecks

Check for common productivity killers:

1. **Permission prompts**: overly restrictive settings forcing repeated approvals
   - Look for missing allow rules for common commands (npm, git, build tools)
   - Check if `Bash` tool has no allows (causes prompt on every command)
2. **Slow tool execution**: MCP servers with high latency, missing caching
3. **Context bloat**: CLAUDE.md over 150 lines, too many always-loaded rules
4. **Missing automation**: repetitive tasks that could be hooks or skills
5. **Context rot**: long sessions without compaction strategy
6. **Redundant instructions**: duplicated guidance between CLAUDE.md and rules

For each bottleneck found, estimate impact: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

### Phase 3: Optimize Permission Strategy

Design a permission strategy that balances safety and speed:

1. **Safe allows** (add to settings.json allow list):
   - Build commands: `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`
   - Lint commands: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`
   - Git read commands: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
   - Language servers and formatters
2. **Smart denies** (keep or add to deny list):
   - Destructive commands: `rm -rf`, `DROP`, `git push --force`
   - Production access: database URLs, deployment commands
   - Sensitive paths: `.env`, credentials, secrets
3. **Contextual permissions**: use path-based rules for directory-specific allows

Present before/after comparison of expected permission prompts.

### Phase 4: Set Up Keyboard Shortcuts

Recommend keyboard shortcut configuration for the user's workflow:

1. **Essential shortcuts** (all workflows):
   - Quick escape: cancel current operation
   - Accept suggestion: fast-approve tool use
   - Compact context: trigger manual compaction
2. **Development shortcuts**:
   - Run tests: one-key test execution
   - Quick commit: stage + commit flow
   - Toggle agent: switch between agent modes
3. **Review shortcuts**:
   - Next file: navigate changed files
   - Approve/reject: fast review actions

Provide configuration snippets for VS Code keybindings.json if applicable.

### Phase 5: Configure Auto-Memory

Set up persistent memory for cross-session efficiency:

1. **Agent memory**: create `.claude/agent-memory/` structure
   - MEMORY.md for session-persistent patterns
   - Topic files for domain knowledge
2. **Memory hygiene rules**:
   - What to save: confirmed patterns, user preferences, debugging solutions
   - What NOT to save: session-specific state, speculative conclusions
   - Size limits: MEMORY.md under 200 lines
3. **Memory templates**: pre-populate with project conventions if detectable

### Phase 6: Generate Optimization Plan

Produce a prioritized optimization plan:

1. Sort all recommendations by impact (HIGH first)
2. Group by effort: Quick Wins (< 5 min), Medium (5-30 min), Investment (30+ min)
3. For each recommendation, provide exact implementation steps
4. Estimate total time saved per week after optimization

## Veto Conditions

- **NEVER** add allow rules for destructive operations to reduce prompts
- **NEVER** disable security hooks for convenience
- **NEVER** remove deny rules without explaining the security tradeoff
- **NEVER** make changes without presenting the plan first -- this task produces a plan, user applies it

---

- [ ] Bottlenecks identified with impact assessment
- [ ] Permission strategy designed with before/after comparison
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts recommended for workflow type
